# Welcome to KnowledgeBits

Everything that has been learned once can be taught faster. The goal of this hub of knowledge is to minimize the number of clicks needed for a reader to know the MVP of any subject.

All documents clearly define the prerequisite knowledge/skills needed to successfully learn whatever is written on that page.

Responsibility is placed on the reader to actively digest material and to fill in the gaps that this document is missing.

## Examples
[Write and debug a custom script](software/scripting.md)
[Computer Literacy](software/computer-literacy.md)
[Competitive Smash Bros](smash-bros/smashbros.md)
[Introduction to Mathematics](math/introduction.md)
[Analogies-as-a-skill](meta/analogies.md)
[Abstraction-as-a-skill](meta/abstraction.md)
